 1. Create folder C:\\Prog and use this folder as the target for all of the following installs.
 2. Install Python 3.4
 3. Install virtualenv:
    1. `pip install virtualenv`
    2. see: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv))
 4. Install source for openssl, freetds, pymssl and build--by running: build_freetds_pymssql.bat (see detailed instructions for how-to)  This should copy files to the right places when done.
    1. Install Visual Studio 2010
    2. Install PERL (from [http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads)](http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads)) then run:

       `PERL module Text::Template
       cd \\Prog\\Perl64\\bin
       cpan Text::Template`
       1. Note: may download andinstall dmake and MinGW gcc complier
    3. Install MinGW (from [http://mingw.org/category/wiki/download)](http://mingw.org/category/wiki/download))
       1. Test by running `mingw\\bin\\ld -v ` If you get an error:

          `mingw-get remove binutils
          mingw-get install binutils`
       2. Run `mingq-get install gcc`
    4. Install NASM (from [http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.12.01/win64/)](http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/2.12.01/win64/))
    5. Install CMake (from [https://cmake.org/download/)](https://cmake.org/download/))
    6. Install git (from [https://git-scm.com/download)](https://git-scm.com/download))
    7. Set up batch files for Visual C
       1. Copy C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin\\vcvars32.bat to \\Prog\\vc32.bat
       2. Copy  C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\\VC\\bin\\x86_amd64\\vcvarsx86_amd64.bat to \\Prog\\vc64.bat
       3. In files copied (vc32.bat and vc64.bat):
          1. Edit and add to the path the appropriate Visual Studio .\\bin folder
          2. Also, add paths to NASM, MINGW, CMAKE, GIT, and PERL in that order
 5. Download freetds source tarball (from [http://openssl.org/source/)](http://openssl.org/source/))
    1. Tarball only.  NOT GitHub repository
    2. Extract, and copy source folder to C:\\Prog
    3. Make two copies of the source folder to C:\\Prog\\openssl-src-32 and C:\\Prog\\openssl-src-64
 6. Build openssl
    1. Win64 Dynamic (the only one really needed for Theas)

       `#perl Configure VC-WIN64A --prefix=C:\\Prog\\openssl-bin-64-VC2010.dynamic
       perl Configure VC-WIN64A no-idea no-mdc2 no-rc --prefix=C:\\Prog\\openssl-bin-64-VC2010.dynamic
       ms\\do_win64a
       nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak
       nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak install`
    2. Optionally, Win64Static (for complete openssl):

       `perl Configure VC-WIN64A --prefix=C:\\openssl-bin-VC-64.dynamic
       ms\\do_win64a
       nmake -f ms\\nt.mak
       nmake -f ms\\nt.mak install`
    3. Don't need to do 32-bit versions (and build may not work with the above 64-bit instructions), but here is how you would do 32-bit if you had to:
       1. Win32 Dynamic
          `perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:\\openssl-bin-VC-32.dynamic
          \#does not work as of 4/21/2016
          \#ms\\do_ms
          ms\\do_nasm
          nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak
          nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak install`
       2. Win32 Dynamic
          `perl Configure VC-WIN32 --prefix=C:\\openssl-bin-VC-32.dynamic
          \#does not work as of 4/21/2016
          \#ms\\do_ms
          ms\\do_nasm
          nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak
          nmake -f ms\\ntdll.mak install`
 7. Set environment variables for openssl
 8. Build freetds
    1.  Run CMake.  Set source to C:/Prog/freetds, and destination to C:/Prog/freetds_binx64 
    2. Click Configure, review settings, click Configure again, click Generate
    3. Open C:\\Prog\\freetds_binx64\\FreeTDS.sln in Visual Studio 2010
    4. Set target to Release, then Build Solution
    5. Let build_freetds_pymssql.bat copy files to the right places
 9. Edit (patch) pymssql source:
    1. Edit \\pymssql\\src_mssql.c and _mssql.pyx to change `DBVERSION_80` to `DBVERSION_72`
    2. See: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pymssql/dkNMLarYiGA](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/pymssql/dkNMLarYiGA)
10. Build pymssql:  python setup.py build
    1. Note:  an error like:
       File "C:\\Python31\\lib\\distutils\\cygwinccompiler.py", line 124, in **init**
       if self.ld_version >= "2.10.90":
       probably means that path to mingw is bad (or that mingw is bad)
11. Install setuptools: ([https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools))
    1. Download zip or tar.gz, unzip, and run: `python ez_setup.py`
       1. or you can try:  `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools`
12. Create egg for pymssql:
    1. From pymssql folder run:  python setup.py bdist_egg
    2. Create folder C:\\Prog\\pymssql_egg
    3. Copy C:\\Prog\\pymssql\\dist\\pymssql-2.2.0.dev0-py3.4-win-amd64.egg to C:\\Prog\\pymssql_egg
13. Change to the venv directory, and run ./Scripts/activate.bat
14. Install setuptools here too (just like in 6 above)
    1. Install pymssql:  easy_install C:\\prog\\pymssql_egg\\pymssql-2.2.0.dev0-py3.4-win-amd64.egg
    2. copy C:\\Prog\\freetds_binx64\\src\\dblib\\Release\\sybdb.dll C:\\Projects\\TheasServer
    3. copy C:\\Prog\\freetds_binx64\\src\\dblib\\Release\\sybdb.dll C:\\Projects\\TheasServer\\venv_theas\\Scripts\\exe.win-amd64-3.4
    4. copy c:\\Prog\\pymssql\*.dll C:\\Projects\\TheasServer
    5. Download MS Visual C++ 2010 SP1 Redistributable Package
15. Install tornado:  pip install tornado
16. Install anything else needed

When running on Windows, Python requires the correct msvcrt.dll file.  This is the Microsoft Visual C Run Time that contains standard C library functions such as printf, memcpy, and cos.

Each version of Python has a dependency on a specific version of the C Runtime.

| Visual C++ | Visual Studio   | Python Version           |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 14\.0      | Visual C++ 2015 | 3\.5, 3.6                |
| 10\.0      | Visual C++ 2010 | 3\.3, 3.4                |
| 9\.0       | Visual C++ 2008 | 2\.6, 2.7, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 |

Starting with Visual C++ 14 Microsoft changed the way msvcrt.dll is deployed.  Previously, this was just a monolithic DLL that could easily be referenced and redistributred.

Now, the C Runtime is "modularized", and consists of a dozen or separate DLL's that are referenced as needed.  These are included as part of the Widows 10 operating system, but are installed independently on Windows 7 and earlier.    The runtime is now called "Universal CRT".  More information is available at: [C++ Team Blog | Introducing the Universal CRT](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2015/03/03/introducing-the-universal-crt)

The various components of the new modularized runtime consist of files like:  

```
api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll 
api-ms-win-crt-filesystem-l1-1-0.dll
api-ms-win-crt-string-l1-1-0.dll
...
```

...and many others.

What's more, with Windows 10 these .DLL files don't actually exist as real .DLL files. 

[Universal CRT not found building with Py3.5 on Win10...](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/1566#issuecomment-146564554) says:

> On Windows 10, the DLLs `api-ms-win-crt-\*.dll` do not actually exist. They are magic words that when passed to the `LoadLibrary` function, will load a completely different DLL as part of what Windows calls an *API Set*. This completely different DLL seems to be in all cases `ucrtbase.dll`.
>
> However, on Windows Vista/7/8, those DLLs do exist. They export functions using the "forwarded exports" feature, where the DLL is redirecting those exports to a different DLL, which is again `ucrtbase.dll`. So on versions of Windows <10, simply including `ucrtbase.dll` by itself is not sufficient, and the other DLLs are needed. But when building on Windows 10, we cannot automatically include them because they do not exist, so the only thing to do is to install the VC 2015 runtime on the Vista/7/8 machine.
>
> The runtime is also made available via Windows Update and should be installed on any machine that has automatic updates running.

What this means is that when packaging a Python application as a .EXE for deployment on Windows (with py2exe or pyinstaller), the required DLL's cannot be found.

This is actually OK:  since the DLL's should be present on the target system (either since they are part of the Windows operating system in Windows 10, or because the VC 2015 runtime is installed), we don't really need or want the DLLs to be included in the Python .EXE package.
