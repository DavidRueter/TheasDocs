However you set up and manage your dev and build environment, you are going to end up with a set of files that need to be served up by the web server (in this case the Theas server).

When you are ready, you can synchronize your build output folder (i.e. your dist folder) with SysWebResources, thereby storing each file in your dist folder as a separate resource for Theas to serve up.
