You can define TheasParams by using HTML <input> tags.

For example, you could set a TheasParam in plain HTML using a hidden input like this:

```html
<input type="hidden" value="abc" name="theas:TestParam1">
```

As you can see, this is just a normal HTML hidden input.  The naming convention for the input is that if the name starts with "theas:" then the value is treated as a TheasParam.

This HTML element would thus create a TheasParam named TestParam1 and would store the value "abc" in the new TheasParam.

But the preferred way to create a TheasParam in HTML is using the server-side Jinja template filters like this:

```handlebars
{{ 'abc'|theasHidden(name='TestParam1') }}
```

This does almost the same thing as the plain HTML example:  it will render an `<input type="hidden"....>`element.  The difference is that the value 'abc' is treated as a default value:  if the TheasParam already exists in the session, the above Jinja statement will ignore the default value of 'abc' and will render the current value of the parameter instead.

Note that when using the Jinja filter you do not need to specify the "theas:" portion of the parameter name.  (You may specify it if you want to, but omitting it reduces clutter.)

If you want to forcibly set the value of the TheasParam using the Jinja filter (i.e. overwrite the TheasParam value if it already exists), you can do this:

```handlebars
{{ 'abc'|theasHidden(name='TestParam1', overwrite=1) }}
```

To clarify, if the TheasParam already exists in the session, and the`overwrite=1` parameter is ***not*** provided to theasHidden, the value of the HTML <input> will be set to the current value of the TheasParam in the session.  The specified default value will be ignored.

If on the other hand the `overwrite=1` parameter ***is*** provided to theasHidden, the value of the TheasParam will be set to the specified default value even if the TheasParam already exists in the session.
